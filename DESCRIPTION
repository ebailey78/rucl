Description: A package of functions for calculating Upper Confidence Limits (UCLs) of the mean.
 Developed primarily for environmental datasets and strongly based off of U.S. EPA's
 ProUCL software package (version 4). Calculates a number of different UCLs and makes basics recommendations
 on which UCL to use based on dataset characteristics.
